An exposition of some of the functions I had to convert from MATLAB into R as well as create from scratch.
There is an example script, 'Example_script.R' which details what a typical script looks like.

Functions depend on several packages:
glmnet, pracma, SuperPCA, MASS, scs, clusterGeneration, CVXR, knockoff
